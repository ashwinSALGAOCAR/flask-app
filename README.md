Flask-app to learn the structure of an app server.
This App has been deployed in 2 ways;

1 - Portable VM using Vagrant and VBox.<br />
2 - Portable Container using Docker.<br />

In the second solution  we have segragated the App Code from the App data as seperated containers. These containers have been Orchestrated using Docker-Compose.
